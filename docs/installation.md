## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "tfutils is not recognized"

This usually means the PATH wasn't set correctly. Solutions:

1. Run the installer again and ensure "Add to PATH" is checked
2. Or manually add the installation directory to your PATH
3. Restart your terminal/command prompt

#### "Python version conflict"

If you see Python version errors:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed
2. Uninstall other Python versions if necessary

#### Installation Fails

If the installation fails:

1. Check you have sufficient disk space
2. Download a fresh copy of the installer

### Verifying Installation Security

TF Utils provides SHA256 checksums for all releases. To verify your download:

1. Download the checksum file (`SHA256SUMS`)
2. Run in PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   Get-FileHash tfutils_setup_vX.X.X.exe -Algorithm SHA256
   ```
3. Compare the output with the checksum in `SHA256SUMS`
4. You will notice the following:
    1. "Why didn't GitHub download the file?" - Seems like it's because the file has no ending. Right-Click on the file
       and click "Open link in new tab" to download the file.
    2. "The checksum doesn't match!" - Yeah I know, currently the file doesn't provide the setup file's checksum. I will
       fix this in the future. üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
